The link for my deployed app can be viewed here: 

I've created a first draft of what will be my professional portfolio gathering my projects to showcase to potential future employees. 

It's got my name in the header section as you can see as its called "Blancas Portfolio". It then has a navigation bar with a section called About Blanca. When you click on it, the UI scrolls down to this section with a picture of myself and a small paragraph explaining "how I got here". 

The navigation bar will also show 3 other projects. I've only completed 1 so far in this bootcamp so only "Project 1" will take you to the link of that first deployed app. 

All Projects in the navigation tab will take you to the sections further down in the app. 

I've placed random pictures that serve as a place holders for those 3 projects. 

When you travel to my first project's image placeholder, you can see it's bigger than the other ones. And again, it will take you to that deployed applicaiton from last week. 

You will be able to see that when you resize my web page to view it from other devices other than just a computer screen, the elements are repositioned as intended via the media queries. The site is responsive thanks to that.
